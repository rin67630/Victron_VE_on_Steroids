To structure the project and avoid complexity, the different options for hardware:  
a) Victron SCCs and Smart Shunts  
b) Different batteries chemistries and capacities  
c) Different displays  
are outsourced in configuration files. The configuration is done by including the relevant files.  
**The Config_Files folder must be placed in the /libraries Folder of your project.**
