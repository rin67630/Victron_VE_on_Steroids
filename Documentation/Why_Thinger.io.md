To provide Long-Term information I am using the free services of Thinger.io

Thinger.io is a dashboard SaaS that lets you use two devices free of charge. Forever.  

Thinger does not primarily use MQTT. It uses a proprietary JSON based transmission directly from the device to the servers of thinger.io  
You don't need a broker and you are not limited by broker's restriction on how fast you transmit data. Sub-second updates are not a problem.   
And Thinger provides Device Properties storage, that is much more powerful than EEPROM.  
Thinger does not need a Grafana server to build Dashboards. You can do that directly on-site.  

So the bottom line: with thinger.io you don't need anything more than your ESP device and a WiFi internet connection.  
No additional computer, no broker, no subscription. No cost (for 2 devices).  
You get:  
 -   gorgeous dashboards, (up to 4 free of charge)
 -   buckets to store long term data (up to 4 free of charge)
 -   device properties (up to 4 free of charge)

(of course the owners of Thinger.io hope you will need more and go for a pay account, but they won't tease you if you remain free, they are really smart guys)  
I've used their services 3 years long free until I decided to go for a pay scheme with 25 devices. And I still have the free accounts.  

I have used Thinger for a couple of other projects like Drok-Juntek-on Steroids, which is a Home Brew MPPT controler built on commercial buck converters.
